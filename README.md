A Proposal
==========

In which I wax effusive about parsers, the neglected link between linguistics and information theory smack in the middle of computer science.

Or, _All about parsers: Machines can understand!_

A summary
---------

In the sixties, a lot of work was done by some awesome people to figure out how to understand written information and language, both natural and programming languages. Some were slow and complete, some were fast but not very good in some ways.

There's been a lot of attempts to make a Theory of Everything kind of parser, and there is even a contender!

But we use parsers every day, most of us just don't realize it, and so much of the time, they're not a big deal.

I'd love to talk about all the ways they're not magical.
